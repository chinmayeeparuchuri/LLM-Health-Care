# LLM-Health-Care
My friend and I participated in an LLM Healthcare Hackathon, where we used BERT for sentiment analysis and emotion classification of healthcare-related tweets. Our project helped identify mental health trends during COVID-19. Competing against top teams, we made it to the finals and secured 4th place, gaining valuable AI and NLP experience.
